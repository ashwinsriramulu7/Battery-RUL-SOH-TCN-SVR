The dataset used in this project is the NASA Battery Dataset, created and made available \
online by the NASA Ames Research Center. It consists of charge/discharge data for different \
batteries, in .mat format. The first step is to convert the .mat files to \
.csv file format for Exploratory Data Analysis and Downstream processing before actually training ML models.
